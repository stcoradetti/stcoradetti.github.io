<div style="color: #777;background-color:white;text-align:center;padding:20px 100px;text-align: justify;">
  <p>We recently lost our beloved Presto, snuggle feind and hiker extraorinaire.  To chase the blues away I thought I'd gather some of my favorite pictures of him on adventures with us and make some notes for posterity.  It turns out there were a lot of them.  Enjoy. <br><hr><br> June 2014 - Bolinas Ridge Trai in Marin County, CA<br>Lori and I had just started dating. She was pretty new to California and I didn't have much experience hiking with dogs out there.  I was pretty taken aback to find out the marquee state and national parks banned all dogs on trails.  It seemed at first that we would be limited to pretty lame trails like this one, a long slow ramp up a dead-grass ridge under the baking sun.  We would find though that there were quite a lot of awesome places we could still go.  Always taking Presto meant we ended up going a ton of less well-known places where we enjoyed some spectacular scenery, usually with zero crowds whatsoever. </p>

  <p>July 2014 - The Lost Coast (0 ft), north of Fort Bragg, CA<br>Our first backpacking adventure with Presto was on 'The Lost Coast' of Northern Califorina, a remote 30-mile stretch where 4,000 foot mountains drop right to the beach and you have to time your hike to the tide table.  It's 'Lost' becuase it was too rugged to build a road there.  Seems like 'Saved Coast' would be better name for it.  Jim Craig and Wilfried Jonkers came along, and we had a grand fourth of July weekend isolated from the entire world except a few parties of extremely adventurous surfers.</p>

  <p>We tried getting Presto to carry some of his own gear on this trip, but he really did not enjoy it.  He would get free sherpa services from here on out.  Keeping the booties refreshed was pretty critical on the rough, rocky sand on this stretch.  A few sections had awkward rocks he need to be carried over, but mostly he did fine.</p>

  <p>July 2014 - Levitt Peak (11569 ft), near Sonora Pass, CA<br>We knew that lots of national forest land was open for dogs, so soon after we started to dispair of our options around the SF Bay area, we went straight for the Sierra.  This was the highest peak I'd summited by over a thousand feet and I barely made the summit.  Presto seemed unbothered.  We know he was working hard though because his heartbeat was very regular.  Usually, whippet hearts just have beat slowly and randomly unless they're running.  It's like their oxygen delivery is so high they don't even have to regulate it when they're not running around.</p>

  <p>August 2014 - Jofree Lakes (5000 ft), north of Whistler, BC<br>Lori went up to British Columbia for the North American Orienteering Champs I came along and did some orienteering too, but mostly hung out with Presto and got her to take some side hiking trips.  At the Jofree Lakes we found this 200 foot perfectly strait pine trunk jutting way out into the neon blue glacial lake and we just had to jump in even though it was literally just above freezing.  Presto was so nervous to be left alone on the shore he came out on the log to shiver next to Lori.</p>

  <p>August 2014 - Pacific Crest Trail (6500 ft), just west of Rainier National Park, WA<br>On the way home we stopped by Seattle to see a friend of Lori's and hit up the PCT just outside of Ranier National Park and found a pretty impressive minor peak near Sourdough Gap.</p>

  <p>November 2014 - Mt Tallac (9739 ft), near Lake Tahoe, CA<br>I was deep in Ph.D. thesis hell and this hike was just what I needed.  We brought along Carol and Greg Walker of Lori's ever expansive orienteering circle.</p>

  <p>February 2015 - Heart Lake (6500 ft), near Mt Shasta, CA<br>Our first attempt to explore the Mt Shasta area.  We had some mildly successfully backcountry skiing on this trip on the side of Mt. Shasta but just sort of puttered around a bit.  This was the trip when Presto discovered that the freeze-thaw cycle makes California snow so dense he can just run around on top of it, even whent it's six feet deep.  He was thrilled.  Here we are the next day at a minor peak overlooking Heart Lake, near yet another section of the Pacific Crest trail.  We were about to start our hike at a different spot and try to get up here with a long 4,000 foot slog, but at the trailhead a couple with a whole pile of Huskies saw our snow shoes and redirected us to a higher, more interesting trailhead.  This was the genesis of one of hiking commandments of 'always listen to recommendations given at trailheads'.</p>

  <p>May 2015 - Unnamed PCT Pass (7800 ft), North West of Lake Tahoe, CA<br>We checked out the popular Five Lakes Trail and found it was way too popular even though the 'Five Lakes' were really five unimpressive ponds.  But we pushed on passed the anticlimax to a random section of the PCT and found this minor pass with a great view.  About an hour later a thunderstorm dumped buckets on us. Then there was a beautiful rainbow.  So yeah, keep going if you've still got the legs for it.  Presto always had the legs for it those days.</p>

  <p>August 2015 - Bull Run Peak (9495 ft), south of Lake Tahoe, CA<br>For several years running I organized big group of lab mates to go camp in the Sierra for the Persied meteor shower.  2015 was a really good one.  We camped in the Pacific Valley, a tiny, isolated valley near the rarely visited Ebbetts Pass.  There was basically zero light pollution and had a nice evening of sky watching.  To warm up we hiked up nearby Bull Run peak for a great view of the Pacific Crest south of Lake Tahoe.  Here Presto is leading the way through a nice meadow under the peak.</p>

  <p>Halloween 2015 - San Jose, CA<br>The New Horizons probe had just reached Pluto and we were signed up for a Halloween urban orienteering event somewhere around San Jose.  So it seemed obvious that Presto needed a New Horizons costume.  We put on togas made of sheets and curtains to dress up as the mythical namesakes of Pluto and Charon and ran around all night with Presto orbiting us.  Best Halloween since I was about 12.</p>

  <p>July 2016 - Dicks Peak (9,974 ft), near Lake Tahoe, CA<br>Here we have Presto napping on a precarious hillside in the middle of an epic 16 mile day hike to the summit of Dick's Peak in the Desolation Wilderness.  We were waiting for another pair of hikers to come down a rocky slope and trying to stay out of the way of any boulders they might dislodge, so we were standing in a fairly awkward spot to keep protected from said boulders. Presto decided this was a fine spot for a nap.  This was the genesis of the P-index.  P = T * C, where T is the time in seconds we've stopped making any forward progress before Presto decides to just plonk down right there and take a nap, and C is the comfy-ness of the ground on a scale of 1 to 10.  The lower the P-index, the harder the hike. A light hike is around P = 1000.  This hike was P = 10.</p>

There was a gaggle or orienteers on this hike; Tori and Carlo, Holly, Anna maybe?  Anyway the overlook was a perfect spot for pictures over a mirror-flat Lake Tahoe.  A very bright sunny day walking around on several feet of snow at 70 degrees.  Archetypal Sierra snow day.</p>

  <p>April 2020 - Berkeley (500 ft)<br>Presto, highly aware he's not supposed to beg or stare at the dinner plates, acts totally casual.  This tiny living room in our tiny Berkeley apartment is where I spent an outrageous percentage of 2020.  The disturbing thing is that I came out of it mostly learning that Lori, Presto, a tiny room, a good supply of books, and occasional outdoor adventures with just the three of us were all I actually needed.  This realization would not be good for my social life long term.</p>

  <p>May 2020 - The Pacific Crest Trail (6,000 ft), south of Mt Shasta.<br>For Labor Day 2020, having just run into waaay to many people on our first attempt to take a summer hike in the mountains, I used all my background knowledge and trail mapping prowess to identify possibly the most empty section of the Pacific Crest trail in northern California  (with any views).  We were out for three days and didn't see a single person or sign of human activity until we passed a single guy on a mountain bike on our way back to the car.</p>

How was he supposed to keep track of us?  So instead of relaxing all day he kept getting up and checking on the one of us he hadn't seen in 10 minutes.  He relaxed a lot more when we put down a dog bed in the hallway at a spot he could see both of us from.</p>

  <p>December 2022 - Umstead State Park, near Raleigh, NC<br>On his last visit down to NC Presto was still game for outside fun, but could not keep up with the Huberman terriers anymore.  Harnessing Presto to Lori, who was harnessed to Boyse, who was chasing me with Luna on a leash meant that we got Boyse to pull Presto around on a few long trail runs.  A good time was had by all. Here we are after a run at Umstead State Park admiring a giant carved tree.</p>
